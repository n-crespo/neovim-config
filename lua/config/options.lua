-- BUG: This is a limitation of using neovim in WSL, and makes yanking and
-- pasting a bit slow. Using "unnamedplus" makes it instant, but then increases
-- startup SUBSTANTIALLY (almost 900ms) (see :StartupTime --> clipboard.vim), so
-- this is my current best solution. Also I had to remove my powershell profile
-- configuration (ðŸ¥²) so it wouldn't take ten years to paste.

-- HACK: I found that if I run neovim as root this is a huge problem, but when
-- I'm not running as root its totally fine. Using the below as clipboard also
-- made pasting take like a full second which was frustrating. Just using a
-- non-root user works like a charm.

-- NOTE: I fixed this! See line 33, where I removed the clipboard syncing
-- entirely, and see the bottom of autocmds.lua to see the autocmds that sync
-- the clipboard for me. Amazing. Clocking 80ms startup time.
